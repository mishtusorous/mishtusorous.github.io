### Functional programming languages 

  * Lisp and 
  * Scheme
  * Java 8 etc. 

### Benefits of Functional programming. 

  * well suited for concurrent and event-driven (or "reactive") programming. 

### A Lambda expression is 

  * an expression with parameter variables has been called a "lambda expression."
  * ??? logician Alonzo Church - mathematical functions - effectively computable. 
  * Type of parameter. Declaration, not required. 
  * No parenthesis 
  * No curly braces
  * No return type 
  * Just the body of the code. It is getting a little too easy for comfort.
  * A lambda expression is a block of code with parameters.
  * Use a lambda expression whenever you want a block of code executed at a later point in time.
  * Lambda expressions can be converted to functional interfaces.
  * Lambda expressions can access effectively final variables from the enclosing scope.
  * Method and constructor references refer to methods or constructors without invoking them.
  * You can now add default and static methods to interfaces that provide concrete implementations.
  * You must resolve any conflicts between default methods from multiple interfaces.


### A Lambda looks like 

```
parameter -> expression body
```

### A block of code 
```
Integer.compare(first.length(), second.length())
```

### with input variables defined 
```
(String first, String second)
     -> Integer.compare(first.length(), second.length())
```

### with more than one line of code 
```
(String first, String second) -> {
     if (first.length() < second.length()) return -1;
     else if (first.length() > second.length()) return 1;
     else return 0;
  }
```

### with variable types that comp can deduce 

You do not have to provide the type 

```
Comparator<String> comp
     = (first, second) // Same as (String first, String second)
        -> Integer.compare(first.length(), second.length());
```

### with a single deducible parameter 

You do not have to provide the parentheses

```
EventHandler<ActionEvent> listener = event ->
     System.out.println("Thanks for clicking!");
        // Instead of (event) -> or (ActionEvent event) ->
```

### with no parameters 
```
() -> { for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) doWork(); }
```
