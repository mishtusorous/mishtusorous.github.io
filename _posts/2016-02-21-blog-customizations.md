  * I customised my /_config.yml to fill in the relevant information
  * I deleted tthe README.md and the custom domain file. 
  * I also deleted the contact form because I wanted to just put my email up for people to use directly.
  * I customised the /about.md page to be about me instead of Pixyll.
  * I tweaked the footer include at /_includes/footer.html to hold my copyright info.
