Custody Reporting (Pro | AMCR)
  * Sathish - Oracle. Communication skills are bad. Tech skills good, as per feedback from team.
  * Jeevan - Oracle. Communication sills could improve. When he spoke, he spoke clearly with data. However he preferred not to speak most of the time. Tech skills is better than Sathish. 

Common problema
  * Team lacks overview of the project, the deliveries that they are doing and how they fit into each other. People at the best only know about their particular tasks. 
  * Communication skills in general leaves a lot to be desired. There were times when we struggled to even understand the names. Or at times we had to go sit by them to comprehend. Just staring ahead with no answers, or saying completely unrelated responses were quite common.

What can be shown and wowed? 
Desktop applications. Because webapps need to host online. We don't have a solution as yet.
Nope. That is not going to work as well. There is no easy way to create windows app. 
Might as well do angular?
