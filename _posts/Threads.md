Infrastructure 


Custody Reporting (Pro | AMCR)
  * Sathish - Oracle. Communication skills are bad. Tech skills good, as per feedback from team.
  * Jeevan - Oracle. Communication sills could improve. When he spoke, he spoke clearly with data. However he preferred not to speak most of the time. Tech skills is better than Sathish. 


Fund Accounting Reporting (Steven | Solvency)
  * Sathish K - Full of hot air. No deliveries. Self proclaimed Delivery lead. We should get rid of this resource - Yogesh. Communication only. 
  * Vijay... - Cognos. Average techie as per team feedback. Ok communication. Did not leave with a very clear understanding of what the personal delivery is for this person. 
  * Binita S - Cognos. New. 6 months total exp. We should get this resource for free. Ok communication. 
ETL (Mike G | Various streams of work)


GIM migration (Deepak)
  * Muthiah - [3yrs total][6 months in project][Informatica core skill] 



Common problema

It has been difficult to contact Chennai resources from Mumbai during office hours. Part of the reason is that there is only one desk phone between two resources. Also they are not allowed to carry cells inside ODCs. 
Next steps 
Jagga to provide a updted phone numbers for each resource and escalation point in spreadsheet. weekend 
Jagga to update phone directory


LVDI is very slow and impacts the efficiency. 

LVDI is apparently about to block any internet connection of any kind. This will be a severe impact to the developer efficiency. 

Communication channels are not sorted out. 
In some teams, Mumbai and Chennai dont have any calls set up at all. Daily, weekly etc. Nothing. 
In some teams, Chennai team have as many as 3 calls a day. 2 with USA. 1 with Mumbai. 
Irrespective of over / under communication in general the teams had very little context around their work. 
When quizzed most of the teams had no idea at all what was being delivered from Mumbai - and in many cases from USA. 
Communication is mostly only one way status update by Chennai to other locations. There seems to be a serious lack of two way communication. 

DAG group. 

Mainframe team - strong. 2 people with around 10 years experaince. Majority having about 5 years experiance. 1 person was quite junior and has a lot to catch up on. We should not be charged for this resource. 

GDW Java team - strong. 2 of them are quite strong. 1 is ok. 
However, their seem to be a 

  * Team lacks overview of the project, the deliveries that they are doing and how they fit into each other. People at the best only know about their particular tasks. 
  * Communication skills in general leaves a lot to be desired. There were times when we struggled to even understand the names. Or at times we had to go sit by them to comprehend. Just staring ahead with no answers, or saying completely unrelated responses were quite common.
