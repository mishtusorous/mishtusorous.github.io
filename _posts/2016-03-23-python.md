### Python, variables
  - You do not need to declare variables before using them (Huh??)
  - Or declare their type. (disaster??)


```
# None is nothing 
mystring = None
myfloat = None
myint = None

# Integer 
myint = 7
a, b = 3, 4

# Floats
myfloat = 7.0
myfloat = float(7)

# Strings 
mystring = 'hello'
mystring = "hello"
mystring = "Don't worry about apostrophes"

# And finally, something which will not work 
print one + two + hello

```
